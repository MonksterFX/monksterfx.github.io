      <description>the serial plotter labeling the series If you have to print some debug messages in the beginning, the Serial Plotter will interpret these as Series Labels. To clear unneacessary labels, just restart the serial plotter (not the mc). In order to catch up the labels, you have to print them to Serial everytime you print values. So it is garanted that the series labels are recognized.
As seperators you can use a tabulator, a space or a comma.</description>

      <description>convert bson timestamp to date So I&amp;rsquo;m used to create a timestamp for logging in the db when something is created. What should go wrong with using mongo bson timestamp. Let me say it this way. As long as you leave it alone in the database it will happily coexist with all the other stuff.
But if you want to use it in javascript it gets complicated.

      <description>the problem If you want to disable your root user of the maschine being accessed via SSH you probably ran into Problems with SFTP on your server. As long you use the root user of the maschine your SFTP will work fine, but if you change your user you will get into trouble.
I&amp;rsquo;m working a lot with docker and bind mounts for config files so I can&amp;rsquo;t change the owner/permission of the directory or file I&amp;rsquo;m binding to.</description>
